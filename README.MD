This is my yambar config,
posted because someone asked.

The river workspaces are a bit hacky,
as I need to map every number to the name I want for the workspace
(in my case Simplified Chinese numerals).

The scripts are:
```
dater : Display the date with numbers like "3rd" "2nd" etc
get-battery-percentage : speaks for itself, edit "cw2015-battery" to match your battery
get-wifi-bars : display wifi signal strength
governor : Change cpupower governor on click
governor-display : display a different icon on governor change
mail : show if there is unread email
```
